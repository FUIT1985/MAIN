###### Changes:

The related file of this patch (translation) is directly in PDF.

In order to allow fixes and improvements, albeit in A4, this patch (translation) has a similar layout (table of contents and page numbering) of the source-book.

In order to help the readers, using the following ISO characters: [ ], I have added some tips about the terms in technical language (for instance: “deployment”, “NP-complete", "TCO", "Disaster recovery", etc.), that the authors have simply mentioned in the source-book.

Because of the dynamic nature of the Internet, any Web addresses or links contained in the source-book and in the patch (translation) may have changed since publication and may no longer be valid.
